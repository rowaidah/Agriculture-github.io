<br>
<p style="color:green;"><i>Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.</i><br>
Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization,<br>
 whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities.<br>
 The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. <br>
 After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago.<br> 
 Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago.<br> 
 Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.<br> 
 Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output,<br>
 though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first.</p>
